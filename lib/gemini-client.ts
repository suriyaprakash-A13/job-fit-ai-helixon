🎯 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TASK:

1. **SKILL MATCHING ANALYSIS (60% Weight):**
   - Compare candidate's technical skills with required skills
   - Identify exact matches, partial matches, and missing skills
   - Evaluate skill depth based on work experience context
   - Calculate skills match percentage: (matched required skills / total required skills) × 100

2. **EXPERIENCE RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT (25% Weight):**
   - Analyze work history relevance to target role
   - Evaluate progression and career growth
   - Assess leadership and project management experience
   - Consider industry experience and company types

3. **EDUCATION & CERTIFICATION EVALUATION (10% Weight):**
   - Match education level with job requirements
   - Evaluate field of study relevance
   - Assess professional certifications value
   - Consider continuous learning indicators

4. **RESUME QUALITY & PROFESSIONALISM (5% Weight):**
   - Evaluate resume structure and clarity
   - Assess communication skills through writing
   - Check for completeness of information
   - Consider professional presentation

🔢 SCORING METHODOLOGY:
- Skills Match Score = (Exact Required Skills Matches / Total Required Skills) × 60
- Experience Score = (Relevance × Years × Seniority Level) × 25
- Education Score = (Degree Match × Field Relevance × Certifications) × 10
- Quality Score = (Structure × Clarity × Completeness) × 5
- TOTAL FIT SCORE = Sum of all weighted scores (0-100)

CRITICAL SKILL MATCHING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Compare the candidate's extracted skills with the job requirements:
   - Required Skills: ${jobDetails.requiredSkills?.join(", ") || "Not specified"}
   - Preferred Skills: ${jobDetails.preferredSkills?.join(", ") || "Not specified"}

2. For "matched_required_skills": ONLY include skills that appear in BOTH the resume AND the required skills list
3. For "matched_preferred_skills": ONLY include skills that appear in BOTH the resume AND the preferred skills list
4. For "missing_required_skills": List required skills that are NOT found in the resume
5. Calculate "skills_match_percentage" as: (matched required skills / total required skills) × 100
