# JobFit.AI - Executive Summary

## üéØ **The Problem**
Traditional resume screening is broken. Recruiters spend 6-8 minutes per resume, miss 42% of qualified candidates due to keyword mismatches, and struggle with inconsistent evaluation standards. A candidate with "JS" experience gets overlooked when the job requires "JavaScript," despite being the same skill.

## üí° **Our Solution**
JobFit.AI is an intelligent resume screening platform that uses advanced AI to understand resumes like humans do, but with superhuman accuracy and speed. Our multi-agent AI system doesn't just match keywords‚Äîit comprehends skills, experience, and qualifications in context.
